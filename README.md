I have hands-on experience programming the 8085 microprocessor, focusing on understanding and implementing low-level operations. My work includes writing assembly language programs to execute various tasks, such as:

Arithmetic Operations: Designing programs to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of multi-byte numbers.
Data Transfer: Managing efficient movement of data between registers, memory, and input/output devices.
Logical Operations: Implementing bitwise operations like AND, OR, XOR, and shifting operations for data manipulation.
Control and Branching: Writing conditional and unconditional jump, call, and return instructions for structured program control.
